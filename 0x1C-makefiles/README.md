A makefile is a special file, containing shell commands, created and named makefile (or Makefile depending upon the system). While in the directory containing this makefile, you will type `make` and the commands in the makefile will be executed. If you create more than one makefile, be certain you are in the correct directory before typing `make`. Make is Unix utility that is designed to start execution of a makefile.
